Name of Project: Assignment 1- Unix and Data

The project has a script (assignment1.sh) that takes parking-2020-03.csv as a positional parameter from the terminal as the input. 
Then, in the script, it is made of up of functions that prints all types of parking infractions (infraction_description), prints the main and max fine amounts (set-fine-amount).
Lastly, it saves one parking infraction to a seperate csv file (output.csv), which includes the infraction_description, set_fine_amount, andnd location2, which are all the original csv file headings.

The project's usages include:
- practice using commands, positional parameters, functions and loops from submodules on a dataset.
- work on navigating directories in scripts
- build skills in searching online for commands not learned directly and learning how to cite these sources in the code

To get started, run the assignment1.sh on your terminal and use the parking-2020-03.csv and output.csv files are your positional paramenters 1&2, respectively.
